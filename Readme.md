# niicat

This is a tool to quickly preview nifti images on the terminal. 
This can be helpful if you are working on a remote server via SSH and do not have
an -X connection. However, it only works with [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) 
because it depends on iTerm2's `imgcat` command.

#### Install:

```
pip install niicat
```
